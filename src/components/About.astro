      BRHacks is a full-day hackathon organized at the Bridgewater-Raritan High School in NJ. We seek to be a competitive event while making space for programming newcomers, as well as provide educational value through specialized workshops. Speeches from industry leaders and academia, as well as a focused theme of the medical industry ensure that we inspire sustainability for the future.
